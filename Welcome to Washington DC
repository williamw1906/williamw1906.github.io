Washington, DC is very diverse and therefore sees plenty of different cultural highlights, with most revolving around the arts. Live music and dance is big in the city, and although go-go performances were banned it is still possible to catch an act in a jazz club in the Anacostia district of the city. Live jazz and blues can be heard everywhere thanks to Duke Ellington, who performed in many clubs as well as along the streets in the U Street Corridor, which was known as Black Broadway.

 Founded on July 16, 1790, Washington, DC is unique among American cities because it was established by the Constitution of the United States to serve as the nation's capital. You can read the actual line at the National Archives.From its beginning, it has been embroiled in political maneuvering, sectional conflicts and issues of race, national identity, compromise and, of course, power.Like many decisions in American history, the location of the new city was to be a compromise: Alexander Hamilton and northern states wanted the new federal government to assume Revolutionary War debts, and Thomas Jefferson and southern states who wanted the capital placed in a location friendly to slave-holding agricultural interests
