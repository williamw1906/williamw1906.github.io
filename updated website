Washington, DC is very diverse and therefore sees plenty of different <a href="#id">cultural</a> highlights, with most revolving around the arts. Live music and dance is big in the city, and although go-go performances were banned it is still possible to catch an act in a jazz club in the Anacostia district of the city. Live jazz and blues can be heard everywhere thanks to Duke Ellington, who performed in many clubs as well as along the streets in the U Street Corridor, which was known as Black Broadway.<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Washington,_D.C.">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Washington,_D.C.
